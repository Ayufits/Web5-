    13 Reasons Why is a controversial Netflix series based on the young adult novel of 
    the same name by Jay Asher. The show follows the story of Clay Jensen, a high 
    school student who receives a series of cassette tapes recorded by his deceased
    classmate, Hannah Baker.

    The tapes reveal the thirteen reasons why Hannah decided to end her life, detailing 
    the traumatic experiences she endured and the people who contributed to her 
    downfall. As Clay listens to the tapes, he becomes increasingly consumed by guilt
    and questions his own role in Hannah's life.

    The series is known for its graphic content, including depictions of suicide, sexual 
    assault, and bullying. While it has been praised for raising awareness about mental 
    health issues, it has also faced criticism for its potentially triggering content and for 
    its portrayal of suicide.
